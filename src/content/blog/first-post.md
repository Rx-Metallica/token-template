5. CI/CD Tools (GitHub Actions)

Streamline Your Workflow

Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) are crucial for modern development practices, and GitHub Actions makes it easy to automate these processes.

Key Features:

Automates testing and deployment pipelines.
Customizable workflows directly in GitHub.
Free for small projects.
Use Case:
Set up a workflow that automatically builds and tests your Node.js project whenever you push changes to the repository. This ensures that your code is always production-ready.
